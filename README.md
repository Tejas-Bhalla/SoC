I have copied the javascript elements from the original website. 
I found making the hamburger button to be tough. The hamburger layout was copied and edited from one available on codepen.io while the overlay was inspired from w3schools.

Understood the Javascript Library used. I am still a little confused regarding the plugins.js file's function. Implemented making the website responsive and understanding the elements used from the source code.
